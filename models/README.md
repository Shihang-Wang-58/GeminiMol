## Download models

Due to file size limitations, the models were stored in the [Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/183WGytS-zy_POlLxEvijEtarow56zmnz?usp=drive_link) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/AlphaMWang). This includes all Cross-Encoder and GeminiMol models in the paper.

To use these models, put them under the ```${GeminiMol}/models/```.
